Dear @scion,

our project on a secure inter-domain routing infrastructure is called "SCION" (see [scion.org](https://www.scion.org)). Since 2017, the project has lived in the [github.com/scionproto]( https://github.com/scionproto) organization. The name for the organization was chosen as scion + proto(col). Our first choice, "scion", was not available since it had already been reserved by you many years prior. Now, as far as can be inferred from the public information in your github profile, this account has been dormant since creation. In the light of this, we're attempting to contact you with the request if it would be possible to hand over the @scion username to our project.
If you receive this message, please get in touch -- either reply to [this issue](https://github.com/matzf/dear-scion/issues/1) here on github, or via email to matzf@scion.org.

Cheers,
Matthias
